# üöÄ ADMIN SYSTEM - QUICK START CHECKLIST

## ‚úÖ Pre-Flight Check

Before you start, make sure:

- [ ] MongoDB is running and connected
- [ ] `.env.local` has `MONGODB_URI` set
- [ ] You have signed up on the platform at least once
- [ ] You know your email address or Clerk User ID

---

## üéØ STEP 1: Promote Yourself to Super Admin

### Choose One Method:

#### Option A: Node.js Script (Easiest)

```bash
# List all users first
node scripts/setup-superadmin.js

# Then promote yourself
node scripts/setup-superadmin.js your-email@example.com
```

#### Option B: MongoDB Direct Command

```javascript
// In MongoDB shell or Compass
db.users.updateOne(
  { email: "your-email@example.com" },
  { $set: { role: "superadmin" } }
);
```

#### Option C: MongoDB Compass GUI

1. Open MongoDB Compass
2. Connect to your database
3. Navigate to `users` collection
4. Find your user document
5. Edit the `role` field to `"superadmin"`
6. Save

**Verify:**

```bash
# Check if promotion worked
node scripts/setup-superadmin.js
# You should see üëë next to your email
```

## üéØ STEP 2: Access Admin Panel

1. Start your dev server (if not running):

```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Sign in to your account

3. Navigate to the admin panel:

```
http://localhost:3000/admin
```

4. You should see:
   - Dashboard with live stats
   - User metrics
   - AI cost tracking
   - Recent activity

---

## üéØ STEP 3: Test Admin Features

### Test User Management:

1. Go to `/admin/users`
2. Search for a user
3. Try these actions (test carefully!):
   - **View user details**
   - **Suspend a test user** (with reason)
   - **Unsuspend the user**
   - **Promote to admin** (super admin only)
   - **Demote back to user**

### Test Dashboard:

1. Go to `/admin`
2. Check that you see:
   - ‚úÖ Total users count
   - ‚úÖ Active users
   - ‚úÖ AI cost tracking (new!)
   - ‚úÖ User growth metrics
   - ‚úÖ Plan distribution
   - ‚úÖ Recent users table
3. Test auto-refresh toggle
4. Test manual refresh button

### Test API Endpoints:

```bash
# In browser DevTools Console or Postman

# Get dashboard stats
fetch('/api/admin/stats').then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)

# Get users list
fetch('/api/admin/users').then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)

# Check your role
fetch('/api/admin/check-role').then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)

# Get audit logs
fetch('/api/admin/logs').then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)
```

---

## üéØ STEP 4: Verify Everything Works

### ‚úÖ Checklist:

- [ ] **I can access `/admin`** without being redirected
- [ ] **Dashboard loads** and shows stats
- [ ] **AI Cost Tracking** section appears
- [ ] **User list** loads at `/admin/users`
- [ ] **I can view** user details
- [ ] **I can suspend** a user
- [ ] **I can unsuspend** a user
- [ ] **I can promote** users (super admin only)
- [ ] **Role check API** works
- [ ] **Audit logs API** returns data
- [ ] **Auto-refresh** works on dashboard
- [ ] **No console errors** appear

---

## üéØ STEP 5: Optional Enhancements

Now that core admin is working, you can add:

### 1. Build Audit Logs UI Page

Create `/admin/logs/page.tsx`:

```tsx
// Displays admin action history
// Uses /api/admin/logs endpoint
// Shows who did what, when
```

### 2. Add Charts/Graphs

```bash
npm install recharts
# Add charts to dashboard for visual analytics
```

### 3. Setup Cron Job for Metrics Caching

Create a cron job or API route that runs daily:

```typescript
// /api/cron/cache-metrics
SystemMetrics.computeAndCache();
```

### 4. Add Email Notifications

```typescript
// Send email when:
// - User is suspended
// - Admin action fails
// - AI costs exceed threshold
```

### 5. Build Export Features

```typescript
// Export users to CSV
// Export analytics to Excel
// Export audit logs
```

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: "Cannot access /admin"

**Solutions:**

- [ ] Make sure you promoted yourself to superadmin
- [ ] Clear browser cache and cookies
- [ ] Sign out and sign in again
- [ ] Check MongoDB that role = "superadmin"

### Problem: "User not found" when running script

**Solutions:**

- [ ] Make sure you've signed up on the platform
- [ ] Check Clerk webhook synced your user
- [ ] Verify email is correct (check case)
- [ ] Try using Clerk User ID instead

### Problem: Dashboard shows "Loading..." forever

**Solutions:**

- [ ] Check browser console for errors
- [ ] Verify MongoDB is connected
- [ ] Check `/api/admin/stats` endpoint directly
- [ ] Look at Network tab in DevTools

### Problem: AI Cost Tracking not showing

**Solutions:**

- [ ] This is expected if API was just updated
- [ ] Refresh the page
- [ ] Check that `stats.aiCosts` exists in API response
- [ ] Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Problem: TypeScript errors

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Rebuild TypeScript
npm run build

# Or just check types
npx tsc --noEmit
```

### Problem: "Module not found" errors

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

A: Yes! Promote as many as you need with the setup script.

A: You can't demote yourself. Have another super admin do it.

**Q: Can I customize admin permissions?**  
A: Yes, modify the `requireAdminAPI()` function to add custom permission checks.

**Q: How much does AI cost tracking help?**  
A: Critical! It helps you monitor Gemini API expenses and set budgets.
