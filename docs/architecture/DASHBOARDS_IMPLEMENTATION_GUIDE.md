## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Animation Strategy

1. **Staggered Entrance**

   - Cards appear one by one (0.1s delays)
   - Charts fade in with slight upward motion
   - Tables animate row by row

2. **Interaction Feedback**

   - Cards scale up on hover (1.02x)
   - Buttons have smooth color transitions
   - Chart tooltips appear smoothly

3. **Loading States**
   - Spinning loader with brand colors
   - Prevents layout shift
   - Smooth transition to content

### Color Palette

```css
Purple: #8b5cf6 (Primary actions, AI features)
Pink: #ec4899 (Secondary actions, costs)
Orange: #f59e0b (Warnings, peaks)
Green: #10b981 (Success, positive trends)
Blue: #3b82f6 (Information, users)
Red: #ef4444 (Errors, negative trends)
```

### Responsive Design

- Mobile: 1 column layout
- Tablet: 2 column layout
- Desktop: 4 column layout for cards, 2 for charts

## 📦 Dependencies Installed

```json
{
  "recharts": "^2.x" - Charts library,
  "framer-motion": "^10.x" - Animation library,
  "date-fns": "^2.x" - Date utilities,
  "papaparse": "^5.x" - CSV export (already installed)
}
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Data Flow

```
Page Component (Client)
  ↓
  Fetch API Endpoints
  ↓
  API Route (Server)
  ↓
  MongoDB Aggregations
  ↓
  Formatted Response
  ↓
  State Update (useState)
  ↓
  Charts Render (Recharts)
  ↓
  Animations (Framer Motion)
```

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Parallel API Calls** - Overview and Usage data fetched simultaneously
2. **MongoDB Aggregations** - Data processed at database level
3. **Date Filling** - Missing dates filled with zeros for complete charts
4. **Lazy Loading** - Charts only render when data is available
5. **Memo Components** - Prevent unnecessary re-renders
