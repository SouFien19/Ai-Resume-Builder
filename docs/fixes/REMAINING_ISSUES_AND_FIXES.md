# 🔧 Remaining Issues and Fixes

## ✅ What's Working Now:

1. ✅ **Webhook is working!**

   ```
   [WEBHOOK] 📨 Received event: user.created
   [WEBHOOK] ✅ User created: user_346pBWGPp58dnHRjWA5INPgvrtr
   ```

2. ✅ User signs in and reaches dashboard
3. ✅ MongoDB connection working
4. ✅ Redis caching working

## ⚠️ Issues Found:

### 1. Clock Skew Warning (Minor - Clerk handles it)

```
Clerk: Clock skew detected. This usually means that your system clock is inaccurate.
JWT issued at date claim (iat) is in the future.
```

**Impact**: Minor - Clerk automatically compensates in development
**Fix**: Sync your Windows clock (Settings → Time & Language → Sync now)

---

### 2. Deprecated API Routes (Medium Priority)

#### `/api/user/role` - Still using old method

```
[DEPRECATED] getUserRole(clerkId) is deprecated. Use getUserRole() from clerkMetadata.ts
```

**Issue**: This route is fetching role from MongoDB instead of JWT
**Impact**: Slower performance, unnecessary DB queries
**Status**: Should be removed or updated to use JWT

#### `/api/sync-user` - Still using old method

```
[DEPRECATED] getUserRole(clerkId) is deprecated.
```

**Issue**: Sync route is still checking MongoDB for roles
**Impact**: Slower user sync
**Status**: Should use JWT for role checks

---

### 3. Infinite Redirect Loop Warning (Critical to Monitor)

```
Clerk: Refreshing the session token resulted in an infinite redirect loop.
This usually means that your Clerk instance keys do not match.
```

**Status**: Appeared initially but user successfully logged in
**Possible Cause**: Clock skew or temporary session issue
**Monitor**: If login fails consistently, verify Clerk keys

---

## 🎯 Next Steps (In Priority Order):

### Step 1: Test Current Login Performance ⏱️

**What to do now**:

1. Sign out completely
2. Sign in again
3. Time how long it takes to reach dashboard

**Expected Result**:

- ✅ Under 2 seconds
- ✅ No dashboard flash/redirect
- ✅ Direct to dashboard (or /admin if superadmin)

**If you see**:

- ❌ Still 5-6 seconds → Need more fixes
- ❌ Dashboard flash → Redirect still happening
- ❌ 401/404 errors → Check Clerk keys

### Step 2: Set Your First Superadmin 👑

**Option A: Via Clerk Dashboard (Recommended)**

1. Go to https://dashboard.clerk.com
2. Click **Users** (left sidebar)
3. Find your email: `soufianelabiadh@gmail.com`
4. Click on the user
5. Scroll to **Public metadata** section
6. Click **Edit**
7. Add this JSON:
   ```json
   {
     "role": "superadmin"
   }
   ```
8. Click **Save**
9. **Sign out and sign back in** (to refresh JWT)

**Option B: Via MongoDB Compass**

1. Open MongoDB Compass
2. Connect to your database
3. Find `users` collection
4. Find your user by email
5. Edit document:
   ```json
   {
     "role": "superadmin"
   }
   ```
6. Save

**Then run migration script** to sync to Clerk:

```powershell
npx tsx scripts/migrate-roles-to-clerk.ts
```

---

### Step 3: Run Migration Script 🔄

**Purpose**: Sync all existing users' roles from MongoDB to Clerk

**Command**:

```powershell
npx tsx scripts/migrate-roles-to-clerk.ts
```

**Expected Output**:

```
🔄 Starting role migration from MongoDB to Clerk...
📊 Found 2 users in database

👤 Processing: soufianelabiadh@gmail.com
   MongoDB role: superadmin
   ✅ Role synced to Clerk

👤 Processing: doxifiw460@djkux.com
   MongoDB role: user
   ✅ Role synced to Clerk

✅ Migration complete! 2/2 users synced
```

---

### Step 4: Fix Deprecated Routes (Optional but Recommended) 🔧

**Issue**: Two routes still use old MongoDB-based role checks

**Routes to fix**:

1. `src/app/api/user/role/route.ts`
2. `src/app/api/sync-user/route.ts`

**Options**:

**Option A**: Delete `/api/user/role` route (recommended)

- Not needed anymore (middleware handles roles)
- Frontend should use `useAuth()` from Clerk

**Option B**: Update to use JWT

- Change to use `getUserRole()` from `clerkMetadata.ts`
- Remove MongoDB query

**For sync-user**: Update to only sync activity, not check role

- Role comes from Clerk webhook
- MongoDB should only store activity data

---

### Step 5: Fix Clock Skew (Optional) ⏰

**Windows Fix**:

1. Press `Win + I` (Settings)
2. Go to **Time & Language** → **Date & Time**
3. Turn **Set time automatically** ON
4. Click **Sync now**

**Or via PowerShell**:

```powershell
w32tm /resync
```

## 📊 Current Performance Analysis

### Before Our Changes:

- ❌ Login time: 5-6 seconds
- ❌ Redirects: 3-4 hops
- ❌ DB queries for role: 2-3 per login
- ❌ Multiple 401/404 errors

### After Webhook Setup:

- ✅ Webhook working (user created successfully)
- ✅ User reaches dashboard
- ⚠️ Some deprecated routes still active
- ⚠️ Clock skew warning (minor)

### Still Need to Test:

- ⏳ Actual login time (need fresh sign-in)
- ⏳ Role-based redirects (need superadmin test)
- ⏳ Admin page access control

## 🆘 If Something Breaks:

### Can't login?

Check Clerk keys in `.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
```

### Infinite redirect loop?

1. Clear browser cache
2. Clear cookies for localhost:3000
3. Try incognito mode

### Webhook not working?

1. Check ngrok is still running
2. Check `.env.local` has `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
3. Check Clerk Dashboard webhook URL is correct

### 404 errors?

Check middleware is compiled: Should see "✓ Compiled middleware in XXXms"

**Current Status**: Webhook working, ready to test login performance! 🚀
