# 📍 Smart Location Detection for Job Matcher

## Overview

The Job Matcher now intelligently detects location from resumes and uses it to suggest relevant jobs in the candidate's area, while allowing users to override with custom location filters.

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### **1. Automatic Location Detection**

When a resume is uploaded or pasted, the system automatically extracts location information using multiple pattern matching strategies:

#### **Detection Patterns:**

1. **Location Keywords**

   ```
   "located in San Francisco, CA"
   "based in New York, NY"
   "residing in Austin, TX"
   "living in Seattle, WA"
   ```

2. **City, State Format**

   ```
   "San Francisco, CA"
   "New York, NY"
   "Los Angeles, CA"
   ```

3. **Major US Cities** (with or without state)
   ```
   New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Phoenix,
   Philadelphia, San Antonio, San Diego, Dallas, Austin,
   Seattle, Denver, Boston, Portland, Miami, etc.
   ```

#### **Supported US States:**

All 50 US states in 2-letter abbreviation format (AL, AK, AZ, AR, CA, CO, CT, etc.)

### **2. Job Location Assignment Logic**

Once location is detected (or filtered), jobs are distributed as follows:

| Scenario                       | Job Distribution                                    |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **No Location Detected**       | 33% Remote / 33% New York / 33% San Francisco       |
| **Location Detected/Filtered** | 55% in specified location / 25% Remote / 20% Hybrid |

#### **Examples:**

**Resume says: "Based in Austin, TX"**

- Job 1: Austin, TX
- Job 2: Remote
- Job 3: Austin, TX
- Job 4: Austin, TX (Hybrid)
- Job 5: Austin, TX
- Job 6: Remote

**User filters: "Seattle, WA"**

- Overrides detected location
- Shows jobs in Seattle instead

## 🎨 Visual Indicators

### **1. Location Detected Badge**

When location is found in resume:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📍 Location detected: San Francisco, CA        │
│ Jobs will be shown for this location.          │
│ Use filters to search other areas.             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- Blue gradient background
- MapPin icon
- Animated entrance (fade + slide)

### **2. Filter Input Enhancement**

Location filter shows detected location:

```
Location (using: San Francisco, CA)
├─ Placeholder: "Override: San Francisco, CA"
└─ User can type to override
```

### **3. Success Toast**

Shows location context:

```
✅ Matches Found!
Found 6 job matches in San Francisco, CA and 4 career suggestions.
```

---

## 🔄 User Flow

### **Scenario 1: Resume with Location**

1. User uploads resume containing "Austin, TX"
2. System detects location automatically
3. Blue badge appears: "📍 Location detected: Austin, TX"
4. User clicks "Find AI-Powered Job Matches"
5. Jobs shown:
   - 3-4 jobs in Austin, TX
   - 1-2 Remote jobs
   - 1 Hybrid job in Austin, TX
6. Toast: "Found 6 job matches in Austin, TX"

### **Scenario 2: User Overrides Location**

1. Resume shows "Austin, TX" (detected)
2. User opens filters
3. Types "Seattle, WA" in Location filter
4. System uses Seattle instead of Austin
5. Jobs shown for Seattle
6. Toast: "Found 6 job matches in Seattle, WA"

### **Scenario 3: No Location in Resume**

1. Resume has no location info
2. No blue badge appears
3. Jobs shown:
   - 2 Remote jobs
   - 2 New York jobs
   - 2 San Francisco jobs
4. User can still use location filter to specify

## 📊 Location Distribution Algorithm

```typescript
const getJobLocation = (idx: number): string => {
  if (!hasUserLocation) {
    // No location detected - show diverse mix
    return idx % 3 === 0
      ? "Remote"
      : idx % 3 === 1
      ? "New York, NY"
      : "San Francisco, CA";
  }

  // Location detected/filtered
  if (idx % 4 === 0) return "Remote"; // 25%
  if (idx % 5 === 0) return `${location} (Hybrid)`; // 20%
  return location; // 55%
};
```

---

## 🎯 Priority System

1. **User Location Filter** (Highest Priority)
   - If user types location in filter → USE IT
2. **Detected Resume Location** (Medium Priority)
   - If detected from resume text → USE IT
3. **Default Mix** (Lowest Priority)
   - If nothing available → Use Remote/NYC/SF mix

```
John Doe
Software Engineer
